ok so four years ago I was working at dominos at the age of 22, I had one child and I was no longer with his mother. His name is John he is 5 years old at the time that I<br> 
wrote this.I did not have my life together and still to this day I do not have my life together,how ever to this day I still dont have my life together at the age of 26. With<br>
that being said at the time I was drinking all the time doing any drugs I could get my hands onto, Just living life like nothing else matter. Then probably about 6 months into<br>
working at dominos this young girl started working there, her name was Miranda. When she first started working there she was 17 and would walk around and act like a typical 17<br>
year old. She would tell the other drivers as they would leave that she loved them and just didn't care. I saw her probably a few weeks before she started working there talking<br>
to her best friend, who also worked there at the time. The first time I saw her I couldnt stop looking at her there was something about her that I couldn't put my finger on that <br>
I mean its not like I lived under a rock or anything I have seen attractive woman before and yes she was and still is attractive, but that wasn't it there was something else to<br>
it that I just couldn't put my finger on. I was so utterly attractid to this young woman that I couldn't think straight for weeks until I saw her again, Then she came in a second<br>
time and all of a sudden I felt my heart beating uncontrolably and I couldn't stop staring.  </p>
<br><br><br>

<p> 
A couple of weeks after that she started working at dominos, and I was so happy that i would finally get the chance to talk to her but I couldn't. For some strange reason I couldn't<br>
get myself to talk to this woman, and everytime I saw her my heart would beat out of control and she would be all that I could think about and I still didn't know why. But then one<br>
day she came in to work in this white dress and said that she just came back from going out to eat by herself and I asked her without thinking about it why did you go by yourself?<br>
and she responded I always do I never have someone to go with. So I asked what have you never been on a date before? and she said no so I asked her right then and there if she wanted<br>
to go out for dinner after work I felt my heart racing so fast that it felt like it was going to jump out of my chest. Then she surprised me by saying yes I couldn't stop thinking <br>
about it the entire shift for first time in a very long time I was looking forward to something that wasn't getting my next high. For me that day that was my high I didn't touch<br>
and boose or any drugs that day, My head was clear I had one thing going through my mind and that was why do I feel this way about this woman and what am I feeling? So the end of <br>
our shift came and I took her out to the cheese cake factory she said it was her favorite place to eat. It was there that I figured it out she was and is the woman I wanted to <br>
spend the rest of my life with. </p> <br><br><br>

<p>
That was a little over 4 years ago probably 4<sup> 1/2 </sup> years now and so much has changed. I don't know who you are anymore I don't know what you are thinking I don't the woman I <br>
fell in love with that day is lost and i have been trieng to find her. I have an amazing child with her who I wouldn't give up for anyone in the world or anything in the world<br>
but I have lost her over the years I know that I havent been the best boyfriend I have said things, done things and pushed her away in the process. her 21<sup>st</sup> birthday was coming<br>
up and we had been fighting like we always had over stupid things that didn't need to be argued about. Then one night I was laying in bed and I felt this sharp and sudden pain<br>
in my chest almost as if someone had ripped my chest open and stuck something through my heart, I could barely breathe I couldn't move I couldn't speak I couldn't do anything<br>
I was paralised and heart broken. I didn't know why I had that feeling and i didn't say anything to her about it wich I should have because right after that happened I started<br>
getting this feeling that something wasn't right like she had her eye on somebody else and that she wasn't being faithful. I had breefly mentioned it in passing that i felt that<br>
way ut she said that I had no reason to feel that way so i brushed it off and didn't think anything of it and then she had been being over the top nice was telling me that she<br>
missed me and wanted to see me as well as some other things, everything seemed good even with the occasional fights. Then one day I had her come by the apartment and I sat down<br>
with her and asked her have you cheated on me she said no. Then I told her I know something is wrong something happened just be honest with me and tell me and so she did. She <br>
had cheated on me with someone that she works with and has had feelings for, for a decent while. I was crushed I wasn't mad I just was in shock and I did not know how to react.<br>
I never thought she was capable of doing such a thing I always thought I would be her last.
</p> <br> <br><br>

<p>
At first I hated her and resented her and then I took a step back calmed down and tried to move forward mistakes happen, but I don't think i will ever be able to get over that.<br>
The fact tht in the end she was capable of hurting me that badly turned my whole world upside down. It made me wake up and realise who I really was, a snap back down to reality<br>
that everything is temporary love, hate, fear, and pain all temporary. There isn't a single persosn in this world who wont try and pull something at some point. I was and am <br>
still so hurt to this very day It's something that will stay with me my whole life I will never forget.I will never forget the feeling I had on that night that she told me that<br>
she was tired and just wanted to go to bed and then when i had that pain shoot through my chest that will never go away. I will never forget the feeling that I have had that <br>
night or the following morning. The pain will never go away, the hurt will never go away this woman saved my life and still hurt me in the end.

</p> <br><br><br>

<p>
Now here I am sitting here after realising that I need to be a better man and doing everything I can to move forward and be a better man, she in the end is the one who doesn't<br>
know what she wants. I have put her through hell for the past 3 years and I wish I knew how to make it up to her and move forward but I dont. She says she needs time but time<br>
is killing me, it's eating away at me every minute that I dont have her in my arms. All the things that I have surpressed for a very long time are starting to come out like a<br>
hurricane of emotion that I can't control. I once explained how she was to me by saying that before her I was dark inside and wandering aimlessly, couldn't find my path. She <br>
lights the path for me she shows me the way she light all the lanterns inside of me I just chose to ignore them. Over the years I have hurt her more then she has ever hurt me <br>
I had been an ass called her names yelled and screamed at her and pushed her away, but she stayed true and stayed with me through it all through me trieng to find myself. that<br>
right there means the world to me, but at the time I just didn't see it I was stubborn and head strong, now I see everything clearly but I fear its to late I fear that shes gone<br>
that I lost the only person in this world who had the perfect personality and wanted every single thing that I wanted (even though i never let her know that wich was another mistake)<br>
and no matter what I do thats lost. I am in fear that I will lose my other half, she has always been the better half of me and I didn't deserve her and I probably still don't<br>
but I owe it to her to do my best to be the man I should have been from the start.
